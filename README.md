# Online Marketplace For Event Related Services

This was my sophomore year project. The project was to design an application with frontend as a web app or a mobile app and database with SQL.

## Description

In this modern world of technology, our app is designed to meet the needs of wedding planning right
at the fingertips. It is a mobile-based application as well as a web-based application for event-related
services. It allows the users to buy and provide services. It offers as a one-stop-shop space for the  to explore vendors/venues, hotels, photographers, and car rentals. This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. 

## Technologies

The mobile application was made with flutter.
Server was made with NodeJS and ExpressJS, and was hosted locally.
NodeJS server provided in event_planner directory.
Database was made with MySQL server, also hosted locally.

Starting the app requires 
- [downloaded .apk of the app, which can be done by connecting a device and running the code.]
- [both the mobile and host computer connected to same internet]
